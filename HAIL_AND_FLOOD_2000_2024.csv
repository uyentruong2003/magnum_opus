Greater than average instability was also present, in part due to anomalously warm Gulf of Mexico SSTs.

Many of these thunderstorms went on to evolve into clusters that were slow moving, or nearly stationary at times. The slow moving or training nature of these thunderstorms, along with torrential rainfall rates, led to flash flooding. The most significant flash flooding occurred on the morning of June 8th.  Slow moving thunderstorms produced near six inches of rain in areas such as Birmingham and Sylacauga. Some additional flash flooding occurred on the evening of June 8th across portions of Birmingham.

Hail covering the ground in places and cars were pulled off the road.,"A long lived quasi-linear convective system (QLCS) developed in northern and central Mississippi and tracked eastward through northern Alabama during the early morning hours of the 20th.  A bow echo with a strong meso-vortex produced a long swath of wind damage from southern Franklin across Lawrence, Morgan, Cullman and Marshall counties.  Numerous trees were uprooted or snapped, indicating wind speeds of at least 70 mph or higher.  Trees were toppled onto two homes in Morgan and Cullman counties resulting in two injuries.  As the bow echo continued eastward, numerous reports of trees and damage to small structures were reported.   Following the storms, a meteorological phenomenon known as a wake low developed which produced a short period of damaging non-thunderstorm winds in Marshall County.  A wind gust of 60 mph was registered with this system at the Albertville, Alabama AWOS station (K8A0).  Several power outages were reported through the event.||A mesoscale convective system rolled through northern and central Alabama during the late evening hours of the 20th, and exited shortly after midnight on the 21st. Prolific lightning was generated with mainly elevated thunderstorms within the anvil region of this system across northern Alabama. A line of strong to severe thunderstorms extended south from the upper level circulation center which tracked east from northwest and west central Alabama. The storms produced sporadic thunderstorm wind damage, knocking down several trees in Franklin County. Most of the damage further east were tree limbs that did cause isolated small power outages. Although most areas received one half to one inch of rainfall, there were local amounts of one to just over two inches. This resulted in mostly nuisance minor street flooding, although one road was closed in Franklin County due to more substantial runoff.",,,

Cordova, in Walker County, was hit twice; by a tornado along the Quasi-Linear Convective System during the early morning hours and again in the afternoon by a long-track EF4 tornado. A long track tornado moved across the city of Tuscaloosa and the western suburbs of Birmingham, resulting in the complete destruction of whole neighborhoods and numerous injuries and fatalities in those heavily populated areas. The same parent supercell produced another violent tornado in east Central Alabama as it tracked across St. Clair and Calhoun Counties, resulting in additional fatalities and incredible damage to a number of neighborhoods. Another violent EF4 tornado tracked across portions of Elmore and Tallapoosa Counties, including Lake Martin, destroying numerous homes and a large section of a mobile home park. ||Most of the violent tornadoes from this day were captured on video by a number of people, including storm spotters and chasers, as well as numerous television news crews and remotely controlled web-enabled video cameras.

This system strengthened as it encountered increasing instability.  Given high amounts of low level wind shear, a break in the line resulted as a strong comma head / mesocyclone developed.  This storm evolved into its own miniature supercell spawning three tornadoes along its track from eastern Lawrence through Morgan, Limestone and Madison Counties.

Trees and power lines were downed resulting in power outages across many of the counties in the Tropical Storm Warning. In addition, rainfall amounts of 4-5 inches (up to 5.55 near Elba, AL) resulted in flash flooding across Coffee County with water covering Highway 189, Highway 203 North and Troy Highway. During the flash flood event, water came close to entering a residence near Elba. Another impact from Hurricane Nate was coastal flooding across the Panhandle and Big Bend coast with around 2-3 feet of inundation at the coast that resulted in minor to moderate coastal erosion. In Gulf county erosion was observed on west facing properties on Cape San Blas. Wave action was responsible for the damage which included beach erosion and destruction of a few stairs from structures down to the beach level. In Wakulla County, a few roads and a dock had water over them with a few inches of water entering two businesses.

Two tornadoes touched down across inland portions of the Florida Panhandle before sunrise, followed by persistent heavy rainfall that resulted in flooding at several river sites.  One of the tornadoes clipped far southern Houston county.  As an upper level trough dug southward across the western and central U.S., southerly flow drew moisture from the Gulf of Mexico northward into the tri-state area over the weekend. Upper air soundings measured this increased moisture with precipitable water values around 1.5 inches on Sunday, well above the 90th percentile and a record for the 12z February 11 sounding, although the record for that date and time are below the average max for this time of year. With a cold front and upper level trough west of the area, the persistent deep layer moisture helped to create a favorable set-up for high rainfall amounts.  This wet pattern resulted in copious amounts of rainfall across the tri-state region. The highest rainfall amounts were across the Florida Panhandle where 8 to 10 inches fell with localized areas receiving more than 10 inches across coastal Walton and Bay counties.

Gordon then tracked northwest into portions of inland southeast Mississippi late on the night of September 4th into the early morning of September 5th.||Gordon produced sustained tropical storm force winds Greene and George counties in Mississippi, coastal Alabama, as well as Escambia County in Florida. The strongest winds were confined to the immediate coast, with Dauphin Island experiencing gusts to hurricane force in the northern eyewall. Wind gusts to hurricane force were reported on Dauphin Island with sustained tropical storm force winds reported as far north as the |Mobile Regional Airport. Some homes on Dauphin Island experienced roof and siding damage. Isolated to scattered down trees and power outages were reported in southern mobile county. Further east, tropical storm force winds, primarily in gusts, impacted areas of Baldwin county south of interstate 10 with the strongest winds along the immediate coast. Strong tropical storm force winds were felt on the Ft. Morgan peninsula where a few homes suffered some siding or roof damage. The steeple was blown off of the Romar Beach Baptist church in Orange Beach. Some trees were downed and scattered power outages were reported. In Escambia County, FL, tropical storm force wind gusts impacted the southern half of the county, especially in the Pensacola metro and the immediate coast. Sustained tropical storm force winds were reported at Pensacola NAS. One fatality was reported near Pensacola when a tree fell onto a mobile home and killed a small child. In Greene and George counties in Mississippi, tropical storm force winds downed trees and power lines, particularly in the Merrill and Richton communities. One home in Richton was significantly damaged by a downed tree. ||Storm surge inundation peaked between 2 to 3 feet across coastal Alabama and Escambia County, FL. This resulted in flooding of typically low lying areas of Mobile and Baldwin Counties, including the west end of Dauphin Island and the US Highway 90 Causeway. The Fort Pickens area in Florida experienced significant coastal flooding and beach erosion. ||Rainfall totals of 6-12 inches were recorded to the east of the center, primarily over Baldwin, Washington, Choctaw, Clarke, Escamba AL, Escambia FL, and Santa Rosa FL.
